# 🎈 Project Structure Description <a name="description"></a>

This project was built using good practices of frontend development. It uses an atomic design for better componentization and file structure.

Was also used a CSS-in-JS library (that is getting strong) named StitchesJs.
StitchesJs improves the development experience, allows ease design systems structuration and its benchmarks have proven that it is also faster than commonly used libraries (i.e. Styled Components).

Was adopted a mobile first design approach, a commonly used pattern in frontend development.

For the http requests, was adopted the use-http library, which holds most of the code in simple hooks.
